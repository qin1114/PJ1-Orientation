In this paper, we study the orientation recognition and standardization of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) images. The required dataset is constructed by performing orientation changes on the standard atlas. We first propose a deep neutral network to recognize orientation on LGE set. Then we adopt the transfer strategy to adapt our proposed model from single modality images to multiple modality images. Finally, the recognition neutral network is embedded in the Cardiac MRI Orientation Adjust Tool, i.e., CMRadjustNet, which supports MRI image visualization, orientation prediction, adjustment, storage operations and batch operations.
